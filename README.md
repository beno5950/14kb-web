Why 14KB per page
This project centers on a core idea: speed. A page that weighs 14KB or less loads faster on slow networks, consumes less energy on mobile devices, and reduces data usage for users on constrained connections. The approach is pragmatic, not dogmatic. You get meaningful features without the burden of heavy frameworks. The 14KB goal guides decisions about assets, tooling, and architecture. It keeps the focus on the essentials: fast parsing, small payloads, crisp visuals, and smooth interactions.

Key benefits
- Faster initial load for users on 3G or flaky networks
- Lower data usage per page view
- Easier to reason about and optimize
- Simple, predictable performance budgets
- Better accessibility and progressive enhancement

What this monorepo covers
This repository brings together multiple tightly related packages that together form a minimal, high‑efficiency web stack. It embraces modern CSS, vanilla JavaScript, and careful dependency management to avoid bloat. The work is organized to help you reuse common primitives while keeping page sizes small. The core ideas are:
- Zero framework dependencies
- Progressive enhancement by default
- Mobile‑first design and responsive UI
- Accessibility as a first‑class concern
- Efficient build and bundle steps

The topics around this project include accessibility, css, esbuild, fast-loading, fastify, javascipt, lightweight, minimal, mobile-first, modern-css, monorepo, nodejs, performance, pnpm-workspaces, progressive-enhancement, responsive-design, sqlite, vanilla-javascript, web-performance, zero-dependency. These guide the structure and decisions across packages.

How to get started
This section helps you bring the project into a working state on your machine. It assumes a clean environment with Node.js installed. If you run into issues, the project’s releases page is the best source of prebuilt artifacts and known-good configurations.

Prerequisites
- Node.js (LTS recommended)
- PNPM as the workspace manager
- Git for cloning and version control
- A code editor with good JavaScript and CSS support

Initial setup
- Clone the repository
  - git clone https://github.com/beno5950/14kb-web.git
- Navigate to the repository
  - cd 14kb-web
- Install dependencies for all workspaces
  - pnpm install
- Bootstrap the monorepo (if you have a bootstrap script)
  - pnpm -w run bootstrap
- Build a local development version
  - pnpm -w run build
- Start the development server
  - pnpm -w run dev

Project structure and workspace layout
This monorepo organizes code into a set of packages that share common tooling while keeping page‑level code lean. The layout is designed to be approachable, even if you are new to monorepos:
- apps/ – projects that can be deployed or run as standalone demos
- packages/ – shared libraries and building blocks
  - ui/ – UI primitives, components, and styles
  - core/ – the minimal runtime, utilities, and helpers
  - data/ – tiny data helpers, sqlite integration, storage shims
  - server/ – lightweight server scaffolding (e.g., a minimal Fastify setup)
  - tooling/ – esbuild configurations, scripts, and workflow helpers
- tests/ – test suites and test utilities
- docs/ – extended docs, guides, and reference material

Core design principles
- Minimalism with purpose: Every line of code earns its keep.
- Predictable performance: Build with a strict performance budget and measure against Core Web Vitals.
- Accessibility first: Semantic HTML, proper ARIA attributes, and keyboard navigability.
- Progressive enhancement: Baseline features work with no JavaScript; enhancements improve UX but do not break core functionality.
- Responsiveness: Design scales gracefully from small screens to large displays.
- Zero framework dependencies: Rely on the browser and small, well‑chosen libraries only when necessary.

Packages and what they do
ui
- A small, carefully designed set of UI primitives: buttons, inputs, cards, and layout helpers.
- Focus on accessibility, keyboard navigability, focus management, and contrast.
- CSS is modular and mobile‑first, with a modern token system.

core
- Lightweight runtime, utilities, and abstractions used by UI and apps.
- Small utility functions, type-safe helpers, and safe defaults.

data
- Tiny data helpers and a minimal interface to store small, local data.
- SQLite bindings are included for lightweight local storage when needed.

server
- A micro web server skeleton using Fastify, designed to be fast, simple, and extensible.
- Middleware for common tasks like health checks, CORS, and logging.

tooling
- Esbuild configurations and build scripts.
- Workspace automation to speed up local development.

Getting hands-on with a page
Follow these steps to build and render a tiny page that undercuts 14KB:
1) Create a minimal HTML shell that loads CSS and a small JS bundle.
2) Use semantic tags: header, nav, main, section, article, footer.
3) Include accessible color contrast and scalable typography.
4) Add progressive enhancements: an optional JS module that improves interactions but remains non-blocking.
5) Use CSS variables and tokens to support theming with a small footprint.
6) Optimize images with responsive sizes and modern formats (AVIF/WEBP when possible).

Performance budgets and goals
- JavaScript: aim for a small, single‑purpose script; avoid large frameworks and polyfills unless strictly needed.
- CSS: use a small, modular set of styles; rely on CSS to handle most layout concerns.
- Images: keep images optimally sized; use modern formats and lazy loading where appropriate.
- Network: keep total payload per page under 14KB for critical render path; consider lazy loading for non-critical assets.
- CPU and memory: minimize heavy computations on the client; offload heavy tasks to the server when possible.

Accessibility guidelines applied
- Semantic HTML5 elements: header, main, nav, main, footer.
- Clear focus states and visible focus outlines.
- ARIA roles only where necessary, with a preference for native semantics.
- Alt text for images, meaningful label associations for form controls.
- Keyboard support for all interactive controls, including components in the UI package.

Performance measurement and testing
- Lighthouse and Core Web Vitals scoring are used to guide optimizations.
- Bundle analysis with esbuild to minimize dead code.
- Visual regression checks to ensure UI remains consistent as you evolve components.
- Automated accessibility checks during the build and test steps.
- Regular small benchmarks to confirm pages stay within the 14KB target.

Development workflow
- Use the PNPM workspace to isolate changes to specific packages.
- Run unit tests for individual packages and integration tests for core flows.
- Use esbuild for fast bundling during development.
- Run linting and formatting to maintain a clean codebase.

Example commands
- pnpm i
- pnpm -w run lint
- pnpm -w run test
- pnpm -w run build
- pnpm -w run dev

Quality assurance
- Ensure that features degrade gracefully on slower devices.
- Validate features with assistive technologies and keyboard testing.
- Confirm that CSS remains accessible when reduced to a basic layout.
- Verify that page payload remains small on the critical view.

Design tokens and theming
- Variables drive typography, spacing, color, and component tokens.
- A light theme covers most use cases; a dark theme is supported as an optional enhancement.
- Tokens connect design decisions to CSS output, ensuring consistency and a small footprint.

Security and privacy considerations
- Keep dependencies minimal to reduce the attack surface.
- Use secure defaults and avoid leaking sensitive data in client-side code.
- Validate and sanitize inputs on the server, even for simple endpoints.
- Be mindful of third‑party scripts and their impact on performance and privacy.

Monorepo governance
- Keep changes small and well-scoped to reduce risk.
- Write tests that cover core behaviors across packages.
- Document any breaking changes in the changelog and follow semantic versioning.
- Coordinate releases to maintain consistency across apps and packages.

Build, test, and release workflow
- Each package has its own build script and tests, but the monorepo offers a unified flow.
- Local development uses fast incremental builds via esbuild.
- CI pipelines run linting, tests, and minimal builds on commit or pull request.
- Releases bundle core assets and provide a ready-to-run artifact for users.
- The official releases page is the source of truth for build artifacts and installers. For the latest releases, visit https://github.com/beno5950/14kb-web/releases.
